			 SGML::SPGroveBuilder

                   A Perl 5 module for loading SGML,
                   XML, and HTML document instances
		       into SGML::Grove objects
		   using James Clark's SGML Parser.

OVERVIEW

    The SGML::SPGrove module links with James Clark's SGML Parser (SP)
    to load SGML, XML, and HTML document instances into SGML::Grove
    objects.

    SGML::SPGroveBuilder takes a system identifier and passes it to SP
    to parse, as each element is parsed from the document SPGrove
    builds SGML::Grove objects to match.  When done parsing, SPGrove
    returns the SGML::Grove object that contains the root element of
    the parsed document and an array (hopefully empty :-) of parser
    errors.

    See the man/pod for SGML::SPGroveBuilder for details on calling
    SGML::SPGroveBuilder.  See the file Changes for user-visible
    changes.  See the Perl module SGML::Grove for details on using the
    grove built by SGML::SPGroveBuilder.

    Newer versions of this module can be found at
    <ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/gdo/>.  SGML::SPGroveBuilder
    shares a mailing list with Quilt.  To subscribe to the Quilt
    mailing list, send a message with the word `subscribe' in the

DIFFERENCES FROM SGML::SPGrove

    SGML::SPGrove was split into SGML::SPGroveBuilder (the module that
    compiles and links with SP to build groves) and SGML::Grove (the
    module that implements the grove objects).  The module name was
    changed from SGML::SPGrove to SGML::SPGroveBuilder.

INSTALLATION

    SGML::SPGroveBuilder requires Perl 5 and James Clark's SP (from
    the Jade distribution).  SP requires a C++ compiler.  Although not
    strictly a requirement, you will probably want to also install
    SGML::Grove.

    WARNING: Remove SGML::SPGrove before installing
    SGML::SPGroveBuilder and SGML::Grove.

    1)  SPGrove needs SP's `libsp.a' and include files.  SP's `make
        install' does not install these.  Create a workarea for
        compiling SP, compile it and keep the workarea until SPGrove
        is done.

        Edit SPGrove's Makefile.PL to point `LIBS' to SP's `lib'
        directory and `INC' to SP's three include directories.  I've
        left my templates in to point the way.

    2)  standard Perl module after that,

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

        Just so you know, SPGrove's copy of SP's library is included
        in the install, that's over a megabyte and a half.

        FYI, a statically linked perl executable (`make perl') appears
        to run significantly faster, in one test, 17 seconds instead
        of 25 seconds.
